    <h1>This is my lab #4</h1>
    <h2>This lab is about github pages</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>We have been learning front-end webdev technologies like html and css which are rendered natively by web browsers.<br>These technologies are very flexible, but they can also be rather verbose.<br>Static website generators are tools that convert lighter-weight text files (like Markdown) into html with corresponding css styles.
    <br>GitHub Pages is a service from GitHub that allows users to host personal and project websites for free.<br>They use a popular static website generator (Jekyll) that allows the content for these websites to be given as Markdown files, but github pages can also host html, css, and javascript files for you as well.<br>In this lab, you will experiment with leverage github pages as a way of putting your web content on the web for free and also have get a little experience with Markdown and with usign a static website generator.<br>The content you make for this lab can be as basic as you want. The point is that you know that you have a place where you can freely post your content.
