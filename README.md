This is my lab #4
====================

This lab is about github pages
------------------------------

### Overview

We have been learning front-end webdev technologies like html and css which are rendered natively by web browsers.  These technologies are very flexible, but they can also be rather verbose.  Static website generators are tools that convert lighter-weight text files (like Markdown) into html with corresponding css styles.

GitHub Pages is a service from GitHub that allows users to host personal and project websites for free.  They use a popular static website generator (Jekyll) that allows the content for these websites to be given as Markdown files, but github pages can also host html, css, and javascript files for you as well.

In this lab, you will experiment with leverage github pages as a way of putting your web content on the web for free and also have get a little experience with Markdown and with usign a static website generator.  The content you make for this lab can be as basic as you want.  The point is that you know that you have a place where you can freely post your content.
  
### What do:
  
> 1. Take a quick look at this page of notes that I made with a static website generator and that I host on github pages (you don't need to read the content; just briefly see what it looks like): [Fundamentals of Programming (C#) (teichert.github.io) (Links to an external site.](https://teichert.github.io/notes/csharp/)
> 2. Register for a github account (you have probably already done this)
> 3. (optional) If you haven't already signed up for [Students - GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/students) (Links to an external site.), you may consider doing so.  It will allow you to have an unlimited number of private github repositories, and it will allow you to host a site on github pages without making the repository public.
> 4. Follow this tutorial to setup a basic github.io website (this should take about 5 minutes after which you should have your own "Hello World" page): [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com) (Links to an external site.)
> 5. Learn about the basics of "Markdown" ([Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)) (Links to an external site.), and incorporate at least 3 elements in your hello world document and make sure that your website looks the way you would have expected. (Again, this doesn't have to have any reasonable content; you are just experiencing markdown and the work of a static website generator via github pages.)
> 6. Add an html page to your github pages site and make sure that you can access it from the web.
> 7. (optional) Here is a brief tutorial on git: https://webtuu.com/blog/04/a-laymans-introduction-to-git


Submit screen-shots of the following:

[2 pts] Your markdown code (can be very brief).<br>
[3 pts] Your browser viewing the generated page via github pages.<br>
[2 pts] Your html code (again can be very brief).<br>
[4 pts] Your browser viewing the page via github pages.<br>
